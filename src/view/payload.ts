/**

 * SAFETY-CRITICAL: hosts apply undocumented limits to the model context a widget contributes, and
 * at least one host evaluates it at DISPLAY time, not at push time — an over-budget push is not
 * rejected with an error, it bricks the widget. `fitPayloadToBudget` therefore has to be
 * structurally incapable of returning a string larger than the budget: every rung of its trimming
 * ladder re-measures, and the last rung is a fixed constant.
 *
 * Ported from the tableau-mcp-eas-auth fork's vizState module, minus the datasource refs: a
 * Tableau Public viz has no query-datasource path for the model to follow, so the refs would be
 * dead weight in the budget.
