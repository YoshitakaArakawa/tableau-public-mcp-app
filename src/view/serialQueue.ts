/**
 * @file Serial, timeout-guarded queue for Embedding API calls.
 *
 * Measured behaviour (in the tableau-mcp-eas-auth fork, against Tableau Cloud) that motivates every
 * rule below: an invalid Embedding API call can hang FOREVER — the returned promise never settles,
 * and the postMessage channel to the viz stays wedged for the rest of the page's life. There is no
 * cancel and no recovery short of a page reload.
 *
 * So a capture must: issue one call at a time (never overlap), bound each individual call, bound the
 * capture as a whole, and stop issuing calls the moment anything has gone wrong. A hung call is
 * abandoned rather than awaited, which is why the queue chains on the raced promise rather than on
 * the caller's promise.
