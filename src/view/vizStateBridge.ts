/**
 * @file Wires `<tableau-viz>` interaction events to a debounced capture-and-push.
 *
 * Three constraints shape this file, all measured in the tableau-mcp-eas-auth fork:
 *
 * 1. One user gesture fans out into a burst of events (a filter change re-fires `filterchanged`
 *    per affected worksheet, plus `summarydatachanged`), so events are debounced to the trailing
 *    edge and a whole burst collapses into one capture.
 * 2. Captures are NOT serialized against each other — `captureVizState` builds its own single-use
 *    queue per call, so two overlapping captures interleave their Embedding API calls, which is the
 *    measured way to hang the postMessage channel. Hence the in-flight guard here: a trigger during
 *    a running capture is remembered, not started.
 * 3. A capture can take up to `OVERALL_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT_MS` (15s), far longer than the debounce
 *    window, so "a capture is running" is the common case during sustained interaction, not an edge.
 *
 * Listeners go on the `<tableau-viz>` ELEMENT, never on the workbook or sheet objects: those are
 * replaced on tab switch (and on a `src` swap), and listeners attached to them would silently stop
 * firing.
